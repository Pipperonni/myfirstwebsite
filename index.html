				<strong style="font-size: 20px;" id="theb">The Beginning</strong>
				<br>
				<p id="ptb">Born and raised in Minnesota, which makes me a Vikings fan for life even though they disappoint us every year.
					As a young person I've always dreamed of moving some place warmer. When I turned 20 I decided to move to Virgina Beach
					and go to Old Dominion college to pursue astronomy. The weather was warmer than that of Minnesota, but there was 
					one major thing missing, my family and friends. After a year living in Virgina Beach, I decided to move back to
					Minnesota. I didn't realize until I was back for a year, how beautiful winter can be. Year later, after moving
					back to Minnesota, I met my kids mother. Three years after meeting my kids mother we had our daughter then two 
					years after her we had our son.</p>

				<h1 id="hblue" style="font-size: 40px; color: aliceblue;">Why Blue?</h1>
				<p id="pblue" style="color: aliceblue;">My name is Blane Severson. Your probably wondering why my page is called "Blue as Blue". When I was in highschool
					I would get letters from different colleges to apply to. On the front of the letter, were your full name would be,
					they had spelled my first name as "Blue". It was funny the first time I saw that, but then I got two more letters from 
					two different colleges spelling my first name "Blue" as well. After telling my friends about the funny missprint of
					my name three times, they all started calling me blue and still do to this day</p>
